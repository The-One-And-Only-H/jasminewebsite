About Me
I am a freelance educator, specialising in Sex and Relationships Education (SRE). Whilst I am very glad that in 2017 new legislation was passed making it a requirement that sex and relationship education take place in both primary and secondary schools, I still think there is a long way to go. Until the government redrafts it’s guidance booklet from 2000, encouraging teachers to argue for abstinence, it is important to have people and policies in place. At university I volunteered with Sexpression, a charity dedicated to going into schools and peer-leading sessions. My experience hosting the Vagina Museum’s education sessions has also brought me into contact with many adults who lament their own, or their children’s, lack of SRE education. This is why I want to be a dedicated SRE teacher. 

My Vision
For every child to receive current and relevant sex and relationships education, at each stage of their development. 
For adults to feel knowledgeable, and comfortable talking about the associated subjects. 
For sex and relationship education to be de-stigmatised.

My Values
Inclusivity - for LGBTQ+ people, and for all ages and abilities. 
Irreverence - to demystify every topic, and question what we know
Supportive - create groups in which people are safe
Open - to discuss any and all topics
Inquisitive - to aspire to always learn more

My Mission
To create a safe teaching space, in which people feel comfortable to question what they know, or what they think they know. 
From this, to create a safer space outside the classroom, in which people feel comfortable to be themselves without fear of repercussions. 
To start a conversation and stimulate an interest in a subject that is an integral part of life
To give people the tools to continue their own education and research.
