# jasminewebsite
I was chatting with my friend Jasmine recently about my adventures in code and mentioned I was looking to work on another project. She suggested I build her a website so I've gone ahead and done exactly that. However, I've done it with a twist.

I've noticed I learn and understand concepts better when I experiment with a practical task. Despite having played around with JavaScript before, I felt compelled to solidify my understanding of this language. I figured the best way to do this was to get to writing.

So I set myself the challenge of building a website using as little HTML as possible, so as to encourage myself to utilise as much JS as possible. I've used jQuery in other projects and have used a small amount in this one also, but I have tried to keep this to a minimum in favour of writing in raw JS instead.

This project is currently a WIP, but you can view it here: https://the-one-and-only-h.github.io/jasminewebsite/index.html

Tech stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3
