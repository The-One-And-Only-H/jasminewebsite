      <a name="about"><h2>About me</h2>

      <p>I am a freelance educator, specialising in Sex and Relationships Education (SRE). Whilst I am very glad that in 2017 new legislation was passed making it a requirement that sex and relationship education take place in both primary and secondary schools, I still think there is a long way to go. Until the government redrafts it’s guidance booklet from 2000, encouraging teachers to argue for abstinence, it is important to have people and policies in place. At university I volunteered with Sexpression, a charity dedicated to going into schools and peer-leading sessions. My experience hosting the Vagina Museum’s education sessions has also brought me into contact with many adults who lament their own, or their children’s, lack of SRE education. This is why I want to be a dedicated SRE teacher.</p>
